# react-ionic-test

- tsconfig.js turned strict to false
- converted ts back to js
- `ionic serve` to start, localhost:8100

# react-reactnative-test

- instructions: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started
- installed expo cli (interesting name) expo init [projectname]
- npm start (localhost:19002)
- not particularly useful for desktop development of app as it doesn't build to webview
- would need android studio and/or xcode to make any real use of this, can't just run in chrome
